# wave-maker
A ProcessingJS script showing waves of random amplitude being drawn across the screen. Meant to be used in [Khan Academy's ProcessingJS environment](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs).

Inspired by [one of Clive Barker's painting in the book Abarat.](http://www.clivebarker.info/doodle.html)
